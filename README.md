phantomJsScrollHeightIssue
==========================

This repo contains jasmine tests that reproduce .scrollHeight issue on PhantomJS.

scrollHeight DOM object property is not updated with the correct value when certain conditions occour:
* test needs to run in 2 nested iframes. Same test passes when it is executed in 1 iframe.
* html is not trivial
